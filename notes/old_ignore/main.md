# Research: Naked Binary Options vs Replicable Binary Options in Prediction Markets

## Core Concept

**Naked binary options** are derivatives that cannot be replicated using exogenous reference prices, making them inherently difficult to hedge. **Replicable binary options**, by contrast, have exogenous reference prices that allow for delta-neutral hedging strategies.

### Examples

**Replicable Binary Options** (have exogenous reference prices):
- **"Will BTC/USD close above $50k on Dec 31?"** → Can be replicated using spot Bitcoin price or futures contracts
- **"Will the Fed raise rates by 50bp in the next meeting?"** → Can be replicated by trading Treasury futures or Fed Funds futures
- **"Will Apple stock close above $200 on Dec 31?"** → Can be replicated using AAPL stock or options

In each case, a professional can buy the underlying asset or derivatives and construct a perfect hedge, eliminating directional risk.

**Naked Binary Options** (no exogenous reference price):
- **"Will candidate X win the 2028 US Presidential election?"** → No underlying asset to trade; only the prediction market itself exists
- **"Will a cure for Alzheimer's be approved by 2030?"** → No tradeable benchmark; outcome determined purely by future events
- **"Will AI capabilities surpass human expert level in protein folding by 2026?"** → No market-traded instrument captures this; purely subjective evaluation

In these cases, there is no external market or asset that provides a hedging mechanism. The prediction market itself is the *only* way to trade the outcome.

### Market Structure Implications

Arbitrageurs and market makers focus almost exclusively on **replicable binary options** because they can:
- Construct delta-neutral portfolios using exogenous reference prices
- Manage and hedge risk systematically
- Extract consistent spreads with limited directional exposure

In contrast, **naked binary options** are largely neglected by professional market participants due to:
- Inability to construct effective hedging mechanisms
- High residual directional risk
- Unpredictable volatility patterns

## Primary Hypothesis: Inefficient Pricing Due to Lack of External Reference Price

**Claim:** Naked binary options trade at extremely inefficient prices precisely because of the absence of an exogenous reference price to anchor valuations.

**Mechanism:**
1. Replicable binary options have external reference prices (spot markets, futures, etc.) that constrain prices to fair value
2. Naked binary options have NO external reference price—the prediction market is the only price discovery mechanism
3. Without an external anchor, prices become untethered from fundamental value
4. Retail and motivated traders dominate, making prices subject to herding, anchoring, and behavioral biases
5. This leads to systematic and persistent mispricing

## Secondary Hypothesis: Adverse Selection in Market Participation

**Claim:** Market participation in naked binary options is skewed towards biased participants.

**Mechanism:** Market participation in naked binary options is skewed towards:
- **Overconfident traders**: Those who believe they have superior information
- **Motivated traders**: Those with strong beliefs independent of market prices
- **Retail participants**: Those lacking motivation to hedge or manage risk

## Secondary Hypothesis: Homogeneous Risk Preferences

**Claim:** Prediction market traders exhibit correlated risk preferences and price sensitivity that amplifies mispricing.

**Mechanism:** Prediction market traders exhibit:
- **Highly correlated risk preferences**: Most traders are optimistic, motivated by expected wins rather than risk management
- **Price sensitivity**: Traders respond dramatically to small price changes
- **Herding tendency**: In the absence of exogenous anchors, traders follow each other

## Testable Predictions and Implications

**From H1 (External Reference Price):**
- Wider bid-ask spreads on naked binary options compared to replicable ones
- Larger deviations from fundamental value
- Greater volatility in implied probabilities

**From H2 (Adverse Selection):**
- This creates a market dominated by biased participants, amplifying mispricing
- Lower participation from professional traders on naked binary options
- Larger predictable deviations from fundamental value during periods of high conviction

**From H3 (Homogeneous Risk Preferences):**
- These characteristics are especially pronounced in naked binary options where no external benchmark exists to correct collective misjudgment
- Evidence of synchronized price movements (herding)
- Asymmetric reactions to news (overweighting recent price movements)
