Naked binary options vs replicable binary options

Arbitrageurs focus on replicable binary options - there is some exogenous reference price which can be used to construct a delta neutral portfolio. Naked binary options are not replicable, which makes it hard to hedge risk and are therefore neglected by market makers and liquidity providers.

Hypothesis: This causes naked binary options to trade at extremely inefficient prices due to a lack of exogenous hedging mechanisms, leading to herding and anchoring behaviour.

Hypothesis: Prediction market traders:
- have completely correlated risk preferences
- are price sensitive

Making them prone to herding and anchoring behaviour, especially in the absence of exogenous hedging mechanisms.

Hypothesis: Market participation is skewed towards overconfident or motivated traders, leading to mispricing of naked binary options.
