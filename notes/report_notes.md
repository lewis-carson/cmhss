1. Begin with a title and introduction where you clearly state which model(s)/method(s)
are used. No abstract is required.



2. Clearly state and motivate your chosen problem and research question(s). Provide
sufficient background information to contextualize this problem for the reader.

What are the main drivers of price between multiple prediction markets?

I do social network analysis to determine which trades are the most common counterparties, move the most volume, and have the highest influence on price movement. I then use regression analysis to determine which features of these trades are the most predictive of price movement. I do text modelling to determine if the composition of trades differs across different types of markets, e.g. political vs. sports vs. entertainment.

3. Document how your data was collected, and briefly state any relevant libraries or
toolkits that were used. Be sure that your dataset is appropriate for the given research
question and sufficient for the model(s)/method(s) employed.



4. Describe the computational model(s)/method(s) and your implementation.


5. Summarize your results.

6. Critically evaluate the model(s)/method(s) and your approach. This should involve
critical analysis of the adequacy of the modelling (e.g., what are the assumptions the
models rely on, and do they all hold; are there factors or biases that might invalidate
conclusions drawn, etc.), as well as comparison with external data and/or published
research on the topic. Note that use of more than one model/method and their
comparisons, as appropriately applied to your problem, will be more highly marked.

7. Discuss what conclusions can be drawn from the model
