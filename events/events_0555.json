        "description": "Donald Trump is scheduled to participate in a bilateral meeting with President Xi of the People's Republic of China on October 29, 2025.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump says the listed term during his appearance at scheduled events featuring the President of China on October 29, 2025. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPluralization/possessive of the listed term will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this market requires a specified number of mentions of a person\u2019s first or last name, a full-name mention will count as one mention (e.g., if a market is about \u201cJoe / Biden 5+ times,\u201d a mention of \u201cJoe Biden\u201d will count once).\n\nThis market is explicitly about scheduled events featuring both Donald Trump and President Xi of the People's Republic of China (https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/topic/calendar/). All such scheduled events featuring both on this date count. Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of named, scheduled events, or which feature one named individual but not the other, will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the events contain a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market. If a qualifying event begins within this market's timeframe and extends past it, the full event will qualify toward this market's resolution.\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by October 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".",
