    "description": "'Lightyear' is an upcoming American computer-animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios. It is a spin-off of the Toy Story film series, serving as an origin story for the fictional test astronaut character who the Buzz Lightyear toy figure featured in the main films was inspired by. It is scheduled for theatrical release in the USA on June 17, 2022.\n\nThis is a market on how much 'Lightyear' will gross domestically on its opening weekend. The \u201cDomestic Weekend\u201d tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl6456065/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (June 17-19) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if 'Lightyear' grosses more than $90,000,000 on the opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release.

    "description": "The 2022 French Open (also known as Roland-Garros) is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks, from May 22 to June 5, 2022, at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris, France, on outdoor clay courts.\n\nWorld No. 2 Daniil Medvedev is a favorite to win the title. His presence at the 2022 French Open, however, is uncertain due to a recent surgery, the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and the fact that he signed up to play at the Libema Open, which starts the day after the French Open final. \n\nThis is a market on whether Daniil Medvedev will play at least one point in the French Open for the Men's Singles Tournament. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Daniil Medvedev plays at least one point in the 2022 French Open. For example, if Daniil Medvedev wins one point during a match in the 2022 French Open and the score is 15-0, or loses one point and the score is 0-15, then this will suffice to resolve the market to \"Yes.\" The market cannot resolve to \"Yes\" until Medvedev has actually played a point. \n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d if the first round of the 2022 French Open starts and Daniil Medvedev is not listed as a participant in any matches. If Medvedev is listed as a participant but does not play a single point, the market will also resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf the 2022 French Open has not started by June 15, 2022, 12:00, the market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the French Open (presently found at https://www.rolandgarros.com/en-us/), however credible media sources will also suffice.",

        "description": "The 2022 French Open (also known as Roland-Garros) is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks, from May 22 to June 5, 2022, at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris, France, on outdoor clay courts.\n\nWorld No. 2 Daniil Medvedev is a favorite to win the title. His presence at the 2022 French Open, however, is uncertain due to a recent surgery, the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and the fact that he signed up to play at the Libema Open, which starts the day after the French Open final. \n\nThis is a market on whether Daniil Medvedev will play at least one point in the French Open for the Men's Singles Tournament. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Daniil Medvedev plays at least one point in the 2022 French Open. For example, if Daniil Medvedev wins one point during a match in the 2022 French Open and the score is 15-0, or loses one point and the score is 0-15, then this will suffice to resolve the market to \"Yes.\" The market cannot resolve to \"Yes\" until Medvedev has actually played a point. \n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d if the first round of the 2022 French Open starts and Daniil Medvedev is not listed as a participant in any matches. If Medvedev is listed as a participant but does not play a single point, the market will also resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf the 2022 French Open has not started by June 15, 2022, 12:00, the market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the French Open (presently found at https://www.rolandgarros.com/en-us/), however credible media sources will also suffice.",
