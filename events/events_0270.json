Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of this event will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the event contains a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by August 13, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source is the audio/video of the listed event.",
