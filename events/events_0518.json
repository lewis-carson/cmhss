Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf old clips or prerecorded videos are played during this appearance where Jeff Yan is speaking, those clips will not count toward this market's resolution. Only live-recorded footage of the specified appearance will qualify.\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this market requires a specified number of mentions of a person\u2019s first or last name, a full-name mention will count as one mention (e.g., if a market is about \u201cJoe / Biden 5+ times,\u201d a mention of \u201cJoe Biden\u201d will count once).\n\nThis market may only resolve to \"No\" if the specified appearance has been published in its entirety and the \"Yes\" condition has not been met. If the appearance has not aired in its entirety by October 22, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve based on what has aired up to that point. If no appearance is aired by this time, or if it is otherwise definitively cancelled by Jeff Yan or TBPN, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source will be audio/video of the appearance.",

A consensus of credible reporting may also be used.",
