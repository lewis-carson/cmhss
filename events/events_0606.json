The margin for this market group doesn\u2019t take into consideration votes for other candidates.\n\nThe states participating in the March 19 Primaries are: Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, and Ohio. \n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the announcement of the primary results from the participating state Republican parties.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nA candidate shall be considered to represent a party in the event that he or she is the nominee, or has a ballot-listed or otherwise identifiable party preference, of the party in question.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the Associated Press, Fox News, and NBC.
