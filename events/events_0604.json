Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nFor example, if the FED cuts rates by 50 bps after a meeting, it would be considered 2 cuts (of 25 bps each).\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be FOMC statements after meetings scheduled in 2024 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. The level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.",

Trump and the second-place candidate. Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the two candidates receives by the sum of all votes received by both candidates in the election.\n\nThe states participating in the Super Tuesday Republican Primaries are: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the announcement of the primary results from the participating state Republican parties. However, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.",

The margin for this market group doesn\u2019t take into consideration votes for other candidates.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald J. Trump performs worse in the Alaska Republican primary compared to all other states participating in the 2024 Super Tuesday Republican Primaries. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nTrump's worst performance will be considered as either the smallest margin of victory if Trump wins all super Tuesday primaries, or largest margin of defeat if Trump loses one or more primaries.\n\n\u2018Margin' is defined as the difference between the percentages of votes received by Donald J. Trump and the second-highest vote-getter. Percentages of the votes received by each of the two candidates will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each receives by the sum of all votes received by both candidates in the election.\n\nThe states participating in the Super Tuesday Republican Primaries are: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia excluding American Samoa.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the announcement of the primary results from the participating state Republican parties.

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThis market pertains to an exploit of Blast itself. Exploits of protocols on Blast will not count.\n\nOnly exploits which have a date listed on the Rekt News Leaderboard as March 7, 2024 or before will count. In the case there is ambiguity over the validity or availability of Rekt's Leaderboard, the project's primary communication channels (e.g. Twitter), and other credible crypto publications will be referenced.",
