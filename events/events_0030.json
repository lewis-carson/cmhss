The \u201cDomestic Weekend\u201d tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt14539740/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the 3-day opening weekend (March 29 - March 31) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if 'Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire' (2024) grosses more than $65,000,000 on its 3-day opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPlease note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo numbers under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend (which typically includes Thursday's previews), regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by April 4, 2024, 11:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.",

        "description": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if as a result of the 2024 United States general elections, any of either the Presidency, Senate, or House of Representatives are not controlled by either the Democratic or Republican party. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\". \n\nA party will be considered to have 'control' of the House of Representatives, if they win a majority of voting seats.\n\nA party will be considered to have 'control' of the Senate if they have more than half of the voting Senate members, or half of the voting Senate members and the Vice President. \n\nA candidate's party is determined by their ballot-listed or otherwise identifiable affiliation with that party at the time the 2024 House, Senate and Presidency are conclusively called by this market's resolution sources. A candidate without a ballot-listed affiliation to either the Democrat or Republican Parties will be considered a member of one of these parties based on the party that they most recently expressed their intent to caucus with at the time the 2024 House, Senate and Presidency are conclusively called by this market's resolution sources.\n\nIf control of the House is ambiguous given the above rules, this market will resolve according to the party affiliation of the first Speaker of the US House who is selected following the 2024 US general election.\n\nIf control of the Senate is ambiguous given the above rules, this market will resolve according to the party affiliation of the first Majority Leader of the US Senate who is selected following the 2024 US general election.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the Associated Press, Fox News, and NBC. This market will resolve once all three sources have conclusively called winners of the House, Senate, and Presidency in the 2024 US general election. If all three sources do not achieve consensus in calling the relevant races for this market, it will resolve based on the official certification.",
