    "description": "At 3:00 PM ET on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @ElonMusk, shall exceed 13,963 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @ElonMusk, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@ElonMusk\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @ElonMusk just before 3:00 pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00 pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Elon Musk, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the settlement source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, the lowest bracket will resolve to \"Yes\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, all contracts in this market will resolve as No. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @ElonMusk will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

    "description": "This market asks if the next YouTube video posted by the MrBeast verified YouTube account will have over 50,000,000 views at any time within the first 7 days it is posted.\n\nIf the next video posted by the MrBeast verified YouTube account has over 50,000,000 views at any time within the first 7 days it is posted, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nAs of this market\u2019s posting, the first video posted after March 14, 2022, by the MrBeast verified YouTube account will be the video this market will base its resolution on.\n\nOnly videos posted to the MrBeast verified YouTube account will count toward the resolution of this market. Any video posted on any account or channel affiliated with the verified MrBeast channel or MrBeast himself but not posted by the MrBeast verified YouTube account will not count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the verified MrBeast YouTube account (https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000/featured). Once a new video is posted, the \u201cviews\u201d counter will be checked at 12:00:00 PM ET each day, starting the day after the video is posted, for a week. For example, if the video is posted on March 17, at 10 AM ET, or March 17, 4 PM ET, the first check will be at 12:00 PM ET, March 18, and so on until the final check on March 24, 12:00 PM ET.\n\nIf the video is deleted during the week time, the market will resolve 50-50. If YouTube is down or otherwise unavailable on the time of the final check, market resolution will be delayed for up to 3 days. If YouTube is still unavailable at that time, this market will resolve to 50-50. If, when checked on any of those three days allotted for a delay, over 50,000,000 views is recorded by YouTube, this market will resolve to \"Yes\".\n\nIf the MrBeast verified YouTube account does not post any new video by July 1, 2022, this market will resolve 50-50.\n",

    "description": "This is a market on whether The James Webb Space Telescope will be launched successfully on or before the resolution time, December 31 2021, 11:59:59 PM ET.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope will be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket from Arianespace's ELA-3 launch complex at European Spaceport located near Kourou, French Guiana. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\", if - according to the resolution sources - the James Webb Space Telescope launches before the resolution time. \"Launches\" will mean that the telescope lifts off the ground and reaches outer space (past the Karman line) in \"one piece\" (i.e. did not explode) before the resolution time. Note that the market will still resolve to \"Yes\" if the telescope is still attached to a rocket, as long as the aforementioned criteria are satisfied. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPlease note, if for any reason, the launch is postponed after the resolution time, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution sources for this market will be the official announcements from NASA, The European Space Agency, or any other credible source.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, the most powerful infrared science observatory ever to be sent into space. From its orbit nearly a million miles from Earth, Webb will study some of the most distant objects in the universe\u2014but first it has to get there. Webb will be folded up inside the rocket that launches it into space, gradually unfurling as it travels to its destination beyond the Moon.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope will be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket, one of the world's most reliable launch vehicles. The Ariane 5 launch vehicle will provide thrust for roughly 26 minutes after liftoff from French Guiana. Moments after upper (second) stage engine cut-off, Webb is supposed to be released from the Ariane 5 and to fly on its own in a fully stowed state.\n\nFor further information about the Webb mission, visit http://www.webb.nasa.gov\n\nWatch the launch live at: https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/#public\n\nFor information about the construction and engineering of the Webb telescope, visit http://www.nasa.gov/webb",

        "description": "This is a market on whether the electric vehicle maker Tesla will announce that it is accepting Dogecoin as a form of payment for any of its vehicles, on or before June 20, 2021, 12:00 PM ET. This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if, before the resolution date, an official announcement is made by Tesla or its authorized representatives that it is accepting Dogecoin as a form payment for any of its vehicles. (\u201cAny\u201d here means that there exists at least one Tesla vehicle that can directly be purchased in Dogecoin.) Official announcements will include press releases, definitive statements, videos, or credible statements from Tesla or its authorized representatives. Tweets from Elon Musk will count. If an announcement that Tesla is accepting Dogecoin to purchase vehicles is made before the resolution date, but actual payments will not be accepted until after the resolution date (e.g. Tesla announces on June 10, 2021 that it will accept Dogecoin for vehicles starting August 1, 2021), this market will resolve \u201cYes\u201d. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

    "title": "How many more tweets will be on the @MCuban account on February 10, 2021?",
    "description": "This is a market on the number of tweets which will be posted to Mark Cuban's Twitter account prior to the resolution date, February 10, 2021 at 3:00pm EST. \n\nAt 3:00pm EST on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @MCuban, shall exceed 3,453 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @MCuban, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@MCuban\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @MCuban just before 3:00 pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00 pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Mark Cuban, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the settlement source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, the lowest bracket will resolve to \"Yes\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, all contracts in this market will resolve as No. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @MarkCuban will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

    "description": "This is a market on the number of tweets which will be posted to Elon Musk's Twitter account prior to the resolution date, February 3, 2021 at 3:00pm EST. \n\nAt 3:00pm EST on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @ElonMusk, shall exceed 13,407 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @ElonMusk, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@ElonMusk\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @ElonMusk just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00 pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Elon Musk, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the settlement source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, the lowest bracket will resolve to \"Yes\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, all contracts in this market will resolve as No. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @ElonMusk will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",
