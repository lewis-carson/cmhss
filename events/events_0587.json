    "description": "This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if Joe Biden's approval rating as reported by FiveThirtyEight will be greater than or equal to 43.3% for the day of January 7, 2023. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d. \n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's approval rating poll aggregator, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/, specifically the approval rating indicated by the green trend line for the resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. \n\nThe resolution data for January 7 will be checked on January 8, 2023 (12 PM ET), and can only resolve after the check. If for any reason (e.g. error, no data taken, etc.) there is no data point for January 7 on the check time, the market will be checked 6 hours later, at 6 PM ET on January 8, 2023. If there is still no data point, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to January 7. \n\nIf Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to January 7. Please note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.",

        "description": "This is a market on whether SpaceX will successfully complete a launch of the next Starship intended to reach outer space, currently dubbed \"SN20\", by March 31, 2023.\n\nA successful launch will mean that Starship takes off from its launchpad and successfully reaches an altitude of 62 miles above sea level. The outcome will be corroborated by examining SpaceX\u2019s official video feed of the launch (https://www.youtube.com/c/SpaceX), as well as secondary video feeds or written reports if necessary.\n\nIf the Starship completes a successful launch by March 31 2023, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nAny subsequent anomaly (e.g. an explosion) after the vehicle reaches 62 miles will have no bearing on the outcome. Any name change of the Starship or replacement of \"SN20\" with another vehicle (i.e. \"SN21\", etc.) will have no bearing on the outcome of the market. Any SpaceX Starship launch that is not intended for outer space will have no bearing on the market. This market will resolve solely on whether the first Starship launch intended to reach outer space will successfully reach 62 miles above sea level by March 31, 2023.",

The primary resolution source for this settlement criterion will be official information released by Binance, official representatives of Binance (e.g. lawyers, spokespeople, etc.), and a consensus of credible reporting.\n\nIf neither of the above criteria are met, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market only concerns Binance.com. Binance.us is not considered for this market.\n\nBinance.com withdrawals being suspended for a majority of users means that a majority of users are unable to withdraw their BTC and/or ETH from Binance (E.g. If a majority of users are unable to withdraw their ETH from Binance, it will satisfy the condition.)\n\nIf Binance.com suspends withdrawals on a day in the last week of February (e.g. They halt token withdrawals on February 27, 2023, 4 PM ET), this market will not resolve until either: 1) withdrawals are reenabled before 7 full days (168 hours) pass, resulting in a \"No\" resolution; 2) 7 full days pass (Feb 27 - Mar 6, 2023, 4 PM ET) where withdrawals are suspended, resulting in a \"Yes\" resolution.",

        "description": "'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' (2022) is an upcoming American super hero film produced by Marvel Studios. It is the third installment of the Ant Man series of films, and the 31st film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is scheduled for theatrical release in the USA on February 17, 2023.\n\nThis is a market on how much \u2018Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' will gross domestically on its 4-day opening weekend. The \u201cDomestic Weekend\u201d tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt10954600 will be used to resolve this market once the values for the 4-day opening weekend (February 17-20) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if \u2018Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\u2019 grosses more than $125,000,000 on its 4-day opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe 4-day opening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number  for the 4-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by February 24, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.",

        "description": "This is a market on a month-to-month inflation, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPI-U), from January to February 2023. Inflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the index increased by more than 0.3 percent (on a seasonally adjusted basis) from January to February 2023 and \u201cNo\u201c otherwise.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS February 2023 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled to be released on March 14, 2023, at 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.4%, the market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, if it is 0.3%, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d).",
