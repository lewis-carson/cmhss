You can read more about that here: https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-mark-100th-day-office-031557423.html\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump says the listed term during his appearance at this event. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by April 29, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market is explicitly about the main speech Trump gives at the named rally. Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of this event will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the events contain a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThe resolution source will be video of the events.",

Changes in the methodology by which Silver Bulletin calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. If Silver Bulletin's approval rating becomes permanently unavailable, RealClearPolitics will be used.\n\nThe resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.",

Changes in the methodology by which Silver Bulletin calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s favorable rating must be higher than 40% for a \u201cYes\u201d resolution; an approval of 40% rating will not qualify.\n\nNote that the approval ratings for this date must be finalized before it is considered for this market (namely once the next data point is available, the previous one is finalized).\n\nThis market's resolution source will be Silver Bulletin' approval rating poll aggregator, https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-approval-ratings-nate-silver-bulletin, specifically the approval rating indicated by the green trend line for the resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which Silver Bulletin calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. If Silver Bulletin's approval rating becomes permanently unavailable, RealClearPolitics will be used.\n\nIf the approval rating for June 1 is not published by June 4, 2025, 12:00 PM ET (noon), the next previous datapoint will be used to resolve this market.",
