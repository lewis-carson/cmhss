Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny announcement from McConnell that he is resigning before his term is up will qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution regardless of when the announced resignation goes into effect. However, announcements from McConnell that he will retire once his term ends, or that he won\u2019t run again, or his removal through other means will not count. \n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official announcements from Mitch McConnell or one of his official representatives.  \n",
