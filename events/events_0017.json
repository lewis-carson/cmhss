    "description": "This is a market on if Donald Trump will tweet an announcement that he successfully won the election before November 5th, 12:01 am EST. If Trump says he \u201cWon\u201d, or claims definitive victory, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. If he claims he won before the market resolution time, but later admits to losing or informally or formally concedes before November 5th, that will overrule his previous claim of winning, and the market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.  If he claims something to the effect of that it looks like he is going to win, or he should win, or *should\u2019ve* won, the market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d. The Tweet must be in the form of an announcement claiming victory, not a tweet about rejecting official results and that he should be the winer. If he rejects the results as being insufficient in some way or needing a recount, but does not definitively claim he Won, in the fashion of claiming victory, the market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d. If the election hasn\u2019t been called yet by resolution time, and Trump has not definitively claimed victory, the market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d. If Trump wins and announces it via Tweet before resolution time, the market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. It boils down to Trump tweeting definitively that he successfully won, not that the results are wrong and he should\u2019ve won: it must resemble a victory tweet. This tweet must come from one of his official Twitter accounts, either https://twitter.com/POTUS or\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump and does not include Retweets. We're aware this is not the most unambiguous metric to resolve the market on, however the Market Integrity Committee will resolve this market in good faith as objectively accurate as possible.",

If Coingecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith by the MIC to resolve the market.\n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $ETH's price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.

        "description": "This is a market on whether the winner of the 2021 Tour de France polka-dot jersey (i.e. King of the Mountains) will be a person of French nationality. The resolution source will be the general rankings for the Mountains classification on the official Tour de France website (https://www.letour.fr/en/rankings; select the \u201cGeneral Ranking\u201d and \u201cClimber\u201d tabs). French nationality will be verified by checking the rider\u2019s nationality as listed on the official Tour de France website (https://www.letour.fr/en/riders). The market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the cyclist who finishes with the most points in the general rankings for the Mountains classification at the 2021 Tour de France is of French nationality and \u201cNo\u201d otherwise. This market will resolve after the final (21st) stage of the Tour de France is completed, currently scheduled for July 18, 2021 (https://www.letour.fr/en/overall-route), and there is a definitive winner of the Mountains classification at the Tour de France. If the official winner of the Mountains classification has not been determined by July 31, 2021, this market will resolve 50-50. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n\nUpdate: In the case of a tie in points for first place in the general rankings for the Mountains classification, the winner will be determined in accordance with the official Tour de France tie break rules (https://storage-aso.lequipe.fr/ASO/cycling_tdf/tdf-2021-reglement.pdf; see See Article 24, Section c, \"best climber classification\").",

    "description": "This is a market on whether more games in Week 1 of the 2021 NFL Preseason will be won by teams in the AFC or in the NFC. For the purposes of this market, games for the 2021 NFL Preseason Week 1 will consist only of those NFL preseason games played between Thursday, August 12, 2021 and Sunday, August 15, 2021, inclusive. This market will resolve to \"AFC\" if, excluding intra-conference games (i.e., games between two AFC teams or between two NFC teams), teams in the AFC win more games in the NFL's Preseason Week 1 than teams in the NFC do. This market will resolve to \"NFC\" if, excluding intra-conference games, teams in the NFC win more games in the NFL's Preseason Week 1 than teams in the AFC do. This market will resolve 50/50 if, excluding intra-conference games, teams in the AFC and teams in the NFC win the same number of games. Membership in the AFC or NFC is determined according to the conference listings on the NFL webpage at: https://www.nfl.com/teams/. A current listing of games scheduled for NFL Preseason Week 1 is available on the NFL webpage at: https://www.nfl.com/schedules/ by selecting \"2021\" and \"Preseason Week 1\" from the drop-down menus. If a game currently listed on that schedule is rescheduled to a date after August 15, 2021, it will not be counted for the purposes of this market. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

        "description": "This is a market on whether more games in Week 1 of the 2021 NFL Preseason will be won by teams in the AFC or in the NFC. For the purposes of this market, games for the 2021 NFL Preseason Week 1 will consist only of those NFL preseason games played between Thursday, August 12, 2021 and Sunday, August 15, 2021, inclusive. This market will resolve to \"AFC\" if, excluding intra-conference games (i.e., games between two AFC teams or between two NFC teams), teams in the AFC win more games in the NFL's Preseason Week 1 than teams in the NFC do. This market will resolve to \"NFC\" if, excluding intra-conference games, teams in the NFC win more games in the NFL's Preseason Week 1 than teams in the AFC do. This market will resolve 50/50 if, excluding intra-conference games, teams in the AFC and teams in the NFC win the same number of games. Membership in the AFC or NFC is determined according to the conference listings on the NFL webpage at: https://www.nfl.com/teams/. A current listing of games scheduled for NFL Preseason Week 1 is available on the NFL webpage at: https://www.nfl.com/schedules/ by selecting \"2021\" and \"Preseason Week 1\" from the drop-down menus. If a game currently listed on that schedule is rescheduled to a date after August 15, 2021, it will not be counted for the purposes of this market. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",
