        "description": "March 14 every year is colloquially known as \"Pi Day\" in the United States, as the date as-written in the country shows 3.14.xxxx. As a result, UNESCO designated March 14 as \"International Mathematics Day\" in 2019.\n\nWordle is a popular game owned by the New York Times you can find here: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html\n\nThis market asks whether the answer to the Wordle of the day's answer on March 14, 2022 will include either the letter \"P\" or the letter \"I\", or both the letters \"P\" and \"I\". If the Wordle of the day's answer on March 14, 2022 contains either the letter \"P\" or the letter \"I\", or both the letters \"P\" and \"I\", this market will resolve to \"Yes\". Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nNote: New Wordles go live every day at 12:00:00 AM ET. This market is for the Wordle that goes live on March 14, 12:00:00 AM ET, and ends on March 15, 12:00:00 AM ET.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the official Wordle game (located at https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html as of this market's writing, however if the URL for the game changes the resolution url will also change). If the official Wordle website is unavailable for all of March 14, 2022, this market will resolve to 50-50.",

    "description": "This is a scalar market on what the fully diluted market cap of Foundation\u2019s token will be in USD 1 week after it begins being actively traded. The \"fully diluted market cap\" is determined by multiplying the price of the token by the total supply of tokens. The lower bound for this market is $250,000,000 and the upper bound is $3,000,000,000. The date by which the token is actively traded refers to the first date the token reaches over $10,000 in volume according to CoinGecko. The fully diluted market cap 1 week after this date, at 12:00 PM ET, will be used for this market\u2019s resolution. For example, if the Foundation token began actively trading on a Tuesday (in ET), the fully diluted market cap of the token would be checked at 12:00 PM ET the following Tuesday in order to resolve this market. If the total supply is infinite, the circulating supply/non-diluted market cap will be used instead to resolve this market. If the CoinGecko website is unavailable at the time of this check, or relevant data is unavailable on CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap will be used instead. If both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap are down, or relevant data is unavailable, then another credible source will be chosen.\n\nIf Foundation does not release a token by December 31, 2021, 11:59:59 PM ET, the market will resolve to $1,625,000,000, which is in between the lower and upper bounds of the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with Foundation token\u2019s fully diluted market cap value in USD. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

    "description": "This is a market on whether SpaceX will successfully complete a launch and landing of their Starship SN15 by May 11, 2021, 12:00 PM ET. A successful launch will mean that Starship SN15 successfully takes off from its launchpad in Boca Chica, TX, and sustains flight for longer than 10 seconds. A successful landing will mean that the Starship SN15 lands in the designated landing area and remains upright for at least 1 hour after landing. The successful launch and landing will be corroborated by examining SpaceX\u2019s official video feed of the launch (https://www.youtube.com/c/SpaceX), as well as secondary video feeds if necessary. If the Starship SN15 completes a successful launch and landing by May 11, 2021, 12:00 PM ET, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.
