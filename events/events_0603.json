Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purposes of this market \"locked\" tokens or non-swappable tokens will not suffice to resolve this market to \"Yes\".\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market is on-chain information and official information from the Wormhole team, however a consensus of credible reporting will also be used.",

Inflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the index increased by more than 0.1 percent (on a seasonally adjusted basis) from January to February 2024 and \u201cNo\u201c otherwise.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS January 2024 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled to be released on February 13, 2024, at 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n----\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.2%, the market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, if it is 0.1%, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d).",

        "description": "This is a market on a month-to-month inflation, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPI-U), from January to February 2024. Inflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the index increased by more than 0.1 percent (on a seasonally adjusted basis) from January to February 2024 and \u201cNo\u201c otherwise.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS January 2024 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled to be released on February 13, 2024, at 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n----\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.2%, the market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, if it is 0.1%, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d).",

Donald J. Trump by November 5, 2024, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf Donald Trump\u2019s case is dismissed, or ends due to a plea agreement without an admission of guilt, this market will resolve to \"No\". If there is a mistrial, this market will stay open to consider further retrials - if by election day Trump has not yet been found guilty or has not entered a guilty plea, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThis market will resolve according to the initial judgment rendered in this case. Any appeals will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be an official judgment delivered by the ruling court; however, other credible reporting may be used.",

Cards which can only be used at select locations such as grocery stores will still qualify for this market. \n\nNote: If any migrant family regardless of size is given payments totaling over $10,000 annualized, it will suffice to resolve this market to \"Yes\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.\n\n\n",
