An incredibly well-preserved 76 million-year-old fossilized Gorgosaurus will go on public display for the first time on July 21 and will be auctioned off for sale on July 28, 2022 (https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2022/natural-history/gorgosaurus?locale=en). A Gorgosaurus has never before been offered at auction.\n\nGorgosaurus was a type of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that roamed what is now the Western plains of North America during the Late Cretaceous Period (Campanian), about 76 million years ago. The Gorgosaurus fossil offered at Sotheby\u2019s was discovered in the Judith River Formation near Havre, Montana, in 2018. It is notable for its remarkable condition, with the skeletal remains of the fierce looking creature preserved as a result of sediments slowly building up around it on the prehistoric river bed where it was found.\n\nThis is a market on the final hammer price for the skeleton. \n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the final hammer price for the Gorgosaurus skeleton (Lot 21) at Sotheby's July 28 \"Natural History, including Gorgosaurus\" auction exceeds $6,000,000 and to \u201cNo\u201d otherwise. \n\nNote: this is a market on the final hammer price at the live auction, which does not include buyer\u2019s premium, fees, or taxes, and is not equivalent to the \u201cLot Sold\u201d price as listed on Sotheby\u2019s website. If, for whatever reason, Sotheby\u2019s does not provide a live broadcast, the recording of the auction, press release, nor the hammer price elsewhere, this market will resolve to the price listed on Sotheby's website.\n\nIf the Gorgosaurus auction doesn't finish by July 29, 2022, 2 AM ET, the market will resolve to 50-50. This market may only resolve to 50-50 after July 29, 2022, 2:00 AM ET has passed.",

A Gorgosaurus has never before been offered at auction.\n\nGorgosaurus was a type of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that roamed what is now the Western plains of North America during the Late Cretaceous Period (Campanian), about 76 million years ago. The Gorgosaurus fossil offered at Sotheby\u2019s was discovered in the Judith River Formation near Havre, Montana, in 2018. It is notable for its remarkable condition, with the skeletal remains of the fierce looking creature preserved as a result of sediments slowly building up around it on the prehistoric river bed where it was found.\n\nThis is a market on the final hammer price for the skeleton. \n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the final hammer price for the Gorgosaurus skeleton (Lot 21) at Sotheby's July 28 \"Natural History, including Gorgosaurus\" auction exceeds $6,000,000 and to \u201cNo\u201d otherwise. \n\nNote: this is a market on the final hammer price at the live auction, which does not include buyer\u2019s premium, fees, or taxes, and is not equivalent to the \u201cLot Sold\u201d price as listed on Sotheby\u2019s website. If, for whatever reason, Sotheby\u2019s does not provide a live broadcast, the recording of the auction, press release, nor the hammer price elsewhere, this market will resolve to the price listed on Sotheby's website.\n\nIf the Gorgosaurus auction doesn't finish by July 29, 2022, 2 AM ET, the market will resolve to 50-50. This market may only resolve to 50-50 after July 29, 2022, 2:00 AM ET has passed.",

The bracket into which the 7-day moving average falls at that time will be the bracket this market resolves to. If the website is down at that time or for any reason data is not accessible on the website at the resolution date, the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC) will wait 24 hours (until 12:00 PM ET on April 10, 2021) and resolve as soon as data is available again. If data is still unavailable at that time, all brackets will resolve to 0.25 USDC.

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana). This market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cMon 1 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 1, 2021. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If CoinGecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $SOL\u2019s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana). This market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cMon 1 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 1, 2021. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If CoinGecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $SOL\u2019s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if an executive order is issued by the Governor of Texas which mandates the use of a face covering over the nose and mouth when inside a commercial entity or other building or space open to the public, or when in an outdoor public space, and \u201cNo\u201d otherwise.
