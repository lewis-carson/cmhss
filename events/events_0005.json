The market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if any US state reports record high 7-day average COVID-19 cases on or after the date of this market\u2019s market inception, July 19, 2021, and on or before December 31, 2021. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d For example, if a US state had a previous record high 7-day average of 10,000 COVID-19 cases, and reached 10,000 or more 7-day average COVID-19 cases again before January 1, 2022, this market would resolve to \u201cYes.\u201d This market will resolve on data from the CDC's Data Tracker, specifically, the 7-day moving average of COVID-19 cases for each of the 50 states, which is available at https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases (navigate to \"Select a state or territory\" and select a given state of interest, and then scroll to \"Data Table for Daily Case Trends\" and view the data in the \"7-Day Moving Avg\" column, which is able to be sorted in descending order). Note that this market only refers to US states, not territories. The resolution source will be reviewed once daily at 8 PM ET, to see if any US states reported record high 7-day average COVID-19 cases. The market will resolve immediately if the criteria for \u201cYes\u201d are met. The final check will be on January 8, 2022, 8 PM ET, checking all days from the creation of this market to December 31, 2021. If the website is down or data is unavailable during the final check, the market will resolve based on the most recent previous check that had data available. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n\n-Note that New York (excluding NYC) and New York City both appear in the dropdown. To determine whether the state of New York reported a record high 7-day COVID-19 case average, the  daily 7-day COVID case averages for New York (excluding NYC) and New York City will be combined to determine 7-day averages, including the record high. \n",

For example, if it lasts 100 seconds and 1 millisecond, the market will resolve to \"Yes.\"\n\nThe time used to resolve this market begins when the singer begins to sing, not when the music starts to play. The timing ends when the singer is finished singing the word \u201cbrave,\u201d no matter how long they hold that note.\n\nIf for any reason, the performance or the Superbowl does not happen by February 15 (11:00 PM ET), this market will resolve to \"No\".",

Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No\". For example, if it lasts 100 seconds and 1 millisecond, the market will resolve to \"Yes.\"\n\nThe time used to resolve this market begins when the singer begins to sing, not when the music starts to play. The timing ends when the singer is finished singing the word \u201cbrave,\u201d no matter how long they hold that note.\n\nIf for any reason, the performance or the Superbowl does not happen by February 15 (11:00 PM ET), this market will resolve to \"No\".",

        "description": "This is a market on whether Joe Biden's disapproval rating will be 40% or higher on May 19, 2021. The resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's approval rating poll aggregator, indicated by the orange trend line and number here, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the disapproval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. If for any reason the resolution source is unavailable on the resolution date, resolution will be delayed up to 48 hours. If still unavailable following that delay, this market will resolve to 50/50. If Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the most recent available disapproval rating. The resolution date for this market will be on May 20, 2021 at 12:00 PM ET according to data published for the day of May 19, 2021. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

TIME's Person of the Year 2022 is picked by the newspaper's editors and is expected to be announced within the first two weeks of December 2022.\n\nIf the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy is named as TIME's Person of the Year for 2022, this market will resolve to \"Yes\". Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPlease note, that this market will resolve to \"Yes\" only if exclusively Volodymyr Zelenskyy is named as the TIME's Person of the Year.

Chauvin is charged criminally in Minnesota on three counts, each of which he has pleaded not guilty to. The maximum number of charges that Chauvin can be convicted of is two. This market will resolve to the number of counts Derek Chauvin is convicted on: zero (not guilty on all counts), one (guilty on one count), or two (guilty on two counts). In the event of a \"hung jury\" or mistrial, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket, \"0\". If the trial is delayed, the market resolution will be postponed until the start of the new trial date. In the event of a judgement of acquittal, this market will still resolve to the number of charges Chauvin is convicted of. In the event that Chauvin is convicted of more than 2 charges, each bracket will resolve equally to 1/3. The resolution source for this market will be the official website of the Minnesota Judicial Branch, specifically the page for this specific case (27-CR-20-12646: State vs. Derek Chauvin) available at https://www.mncourts.gov/media/StateofMinnesotavDerekChauvin.",

The resolution source for this market will be the BLS May 2021 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled for release on June 10, 2021, 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data. Note that the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.4%, 0.1%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (i.e. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.3%, the market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d, if it is 0.4%, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d).",

Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on August 20, 2021.

If Coingecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith by the MIC to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $DOGE\u2019s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

The lower bound for this market is $1 mllion, and the upper bound is $10 million. You can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with sale price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.\n\n The auction is being conducted by Christie's and is scheduled to take place from 25 February to 11 March. In the event the auction is postponed, resolution of this market will be delayed accordingly. If the auction is canceled entirely, this market will resolve to the lower bound, $1 million. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",
