        "description": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Karoline Leavitt says the listed term during the next White House press briefing she participates in. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this market requires a specified number of mentions of a person\u2019s first or last name, a full-name mention will count as one mention (e.g., if a market is about \u201cJoe / Biden 5+ times,\u201d a mention of \u201cJoe Biden\u201d will count once).\n\nIf no such press briefing happens by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\". If Leavitt ceases to be White House press secretary for any length of time by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market refers exclusively to regular White House press briefings, titled \"Press Briefing by the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt\" as part of the official schedule originally published by the White House Press Pool (https://www.forth.news/whpool). \"New Media\" press briefings, special briefings with a different title description such as those including extra guests, or any originally unscheduled press briefings will not be considered.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be footage of the relevant briefing.",

For the 2025 Mercury Prize, the Albums of the Year (shortlist) was announced on September 10, 2025, and the award ceremony is scheduled to take place on October 16, 2025, in Newcastle.\n\nThis market will resolve according to the listed artist who wins the 2025 Mercury Prize for Album of the Year.\n\nIn the case of a tie for the winner (e.g., multiple recipients), this market will resolve in favor of the listed artist whose listed name comes first alphabetically.\n\nIf, for any reason, no winner is officially announced by April 30, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"Other\".\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official announcements from the Mercury Prize (https://www.mercuryprize.com), but a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.",
