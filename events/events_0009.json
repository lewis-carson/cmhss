    "title": "How many more tweets will be on the @SouljaBoy account on February 25, 2021?",
    "description": "This is a market on the number of tweets that will be posted to Soulja Boy\u2019s Twitter account prior to the resolution date, February 25, 2021 at 3:00pm EST. \n\nAt 3:00pm EST on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @SouljaBoy, shall exceed 122,116 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @SouljaBoy, then clicking the verified account labeled \u201c@SouljaBoy\u201d from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @SouljaBoy just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Soulja Boy, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @SouljaBoy will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @SouljaBoy, then clicking the verified account labeled \u201c@SouljaBoy\u201d from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @SouljaBoy just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Soulja Boy, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @SouljaBoy will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

As of the date of market creation, 10-21-20, Dharma has announced their intention to submit a UNI governance proposal on October 23rd, 2020, for essentially airdropping UNI to users who traded on Uniswap through  applications like Dharma, prior to the UNI airdrop snapshot. \u201cPhase 1 includes users of the application integrations\u201d.

His handle @realDonaldTrump had over 88.9 million followers.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald J. Trump's verified Twitter account (@realDonaldTrump) tweets at least once after May 10, 2022, and by December 31, 2022, (11:59:59 PM ET). Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be Donald J. Trump's verified Twitter account: https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump.\n\nPlease note, only the @realDonaldTrump verified Twitter account counts for this market, regardless of the URL for this profile. If Donald J. Trump tweets from another account, it has no bearing on the resolution of this market.",

The date by which the token is actively traded refers to the first date the token reaches over $10,000 in volume according to CoinGecko. The fully diluted market cap 1 week after this date, at 12:00 PM ET, will be used for this market\u2019s resolution. For example, if the SuperRare token began actively trading on a Tuesday (in ET), the fully diluted market cap of the token would be checked at 12:00 PM ET the following Tuesday in order to resolve this market. If the total supply is infinite, the circulating supply/non-diluted market cap will be used instead to resolve this market. If the CoinGecko website is unavailable at the time of this check, or relevant data is unavailable on CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap will be used instead. If both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap are down, or relevant data is unavailable, then another credible source will be chosen.\n\nIf SuperRare does not release a token by December 31, 2021, 11:59:59 PM ET, the market will resolve to $1,625,000,000, which is in between the lower and upper bounds of the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with SuperRare token\u2019s fully diluted market cap value in USD. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",
