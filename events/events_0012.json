    "description": "This is a market on whether the United States will report a 7-day average of COVID-19 cases for the date of November 17th that is higher than the 7-day average of COVID-19 cases reported for the date of November 10th. This market will resolve on data from the CDC's Data Tracker, specifically, the 7-day moving average of COVID-19 cases for the United States, which is available at https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases (navigate to \"Select a state or territory\" and select \u201cUnited States\u201d, and then scroll to \"Data Table for Daily Case Trends\" and view the data in the \"7-Day Moving Avg\" column, which is able to be sorted in descending order). \n\nThe resolution source will be reviewed at 8 PM ET on November 24th to check the 7-day average for both the dates of November 17th and November 10th.  If the 7-day average for November 17th exceeds that of November 10th at this check, \"Yes\" will win.  Otherwise, \"No\" will win.  If the resolution source is unavailable at that time, the resolution source will be checked again at 8pm the following and each subsequent day until it is available. If the resolution source is unavailable by December 1, 2021, 8 PM ET, another credible source will be checked instead.",

    "description": "This is a market on whether six or more out of the eleven starting players for Germany will kneel in political protest before the Euro 2020 match between Germany and France, scheduled to take place on June 15, 2021 at 3:00 PM ET. This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if six of more of the eleven of Germany\u2019s starting players kneel in political protest before the kickoff or within the first thirty seconds of the Euro 2020 match. For this market, \u201ckneel in political protest\u201d will mean the following: (1) the player assumes a position where at least one of their knees is touching the grass on the soccer pitch, (2) the kneeling is done as an act of political protest (as determined by MIC and reasonable consensus), and is not, for example, a non-political act such as kneeling to tie one\u2019s shoes, (3) occurs on the soccer pitch prior to the beginning of the match. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d. The resolution source will be official live broadcasts of the match, as well as any relevant, credible, news articles, or photos or videos of the match. If, for any reason, this match is postponed and a new match date is set for a start time of June 22, 2021, 3:00 PM ET or earlier, the same rules for market resolution will apply for the rescheduled match. If this match is rescheduled for a start time on any date after June 22, 2021, 3:00 PM ET, or is canceled altogether, the market will resolve 50-50. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

The lower bound for this market is $60,000.00 USD and the upper bound is $120,000.00 USD. The resolution source for this market will be the August 2021 spreadsheet documenting medallion transfers provided by the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/businesses/medallion-transfers.page). The market is only for unrestricted taxi medallions. Rows in the spreadsheet showing a price of $0.00 will not be included in the average computation. Rows not including a number of medallions in the transfer will not included in the average computation. This market will resolve when the data is posted by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission at the resolution source. If the resolution data is not available by September 30, 2021, the resolution price will be set to the average unrestricted NYC medallion price for months January - July 2021. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",
