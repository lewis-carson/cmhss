Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, the margin of victory is the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by each candidate in the election. Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each candidate receives by the sum of all votes received by both candidates.\n\nFor example, if Candidate A receives 53% of the votes, and Candidate B receives 47% of the votes, the difference will be found by subtracting 47 from 53, thus the margin of victory in this case would equal 6 (|Candidate A% - Candidate B%| = Margin of Victory).\n\nDetermination of the margin of victory in the Georgia Senate runoff election will be based on official election results (e.g. https://sos.ga.gov/).\n",

        "description": "In the 2022 midterm election for United States Senator from Georgia, no candidate received a majority of votes. This has triggered a run-off election between the two candidates who received the greatest number of votes: Raphael Warnock (Democrat) and Herschel Walker (Republican).  \n\nThe runoff election for US Senator from Georgia is scheduled for December 6, 2022.  \n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the margin of victory in the runoff election for US Senator from Georgia is 5.0% or greater. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".  \n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, the margin of victory is the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by each candidate in the election. Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each candidate receives by the sum of all votes received by both candidates.  \n\nFor example, if Candidate A receives 53% of the votes, and Candidate B receives 47% of the votes, the difference will be found by subtracting 47 from 53, thus the margin of victory in this case would equal 6 (|Candidate A% - Candidate B%| = Margin of Victory).  \n\nDetermination of the margin of victory in the Georgia Senate runoff election will be based on official election results (e.g. https://sos.ga.gov/). \n",

Eight teams are seeded with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the\u00a0FIFA World Rankings\u00a0or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups.

Eight teams are seeded with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the\u00a0FIFA World Rankings\u00a0or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups. The other teams are assigned to different pots, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups.\n\nEach group plays a\u00a0round-robin tournament, in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. Thus a total of six matches are played within each group.\u00a0The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within the groups.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from FIFA (e.g. https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022/scores-fixtures), including official footage from the World Cup, however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf no team from this group has advanced to the second round by December 18, 2022, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf at any point it can be definitively determined that it will be impossible for this team to move on to the second round, this market will immediately resolve to \"No\". Likewise, if it can at any point be definitively determined that this team is moving on to the second round, this market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\".\n\n--\n\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup is the 22nd edition of the World Cup, and is scheduled to be played in Qatar over November 20 - December 18, 2022.\n\nIn the group stage, teams compete within eight groups composed of four teams each. Eight teams are seeded with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the\u00a0FIFA World Rankings\u00a0or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups. The other teams are assigned to different pots, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups.\n\nEach group plays a\u00a0round-robin tournament, in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. Thus a total of six matches are played within each group.\u00a0The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within the groups.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from FIFA (e.g. https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022/scores-fixtures), including official footage from the World Cup, however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n",

If there is still no data point, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to December 29. \n\nIf Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to December 29. \n\nPlease note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d. \n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's approval rating poll aggregator, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/, specifically the approval rating indicated by the green trend line for the resolution date.\n\nChanges in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.   \n\nThe resolution data for December 29 will be checked on December 30, 2022 (12 PM ET), and can only resolve after the check. \n\nIf for any reason (e.g. error, no data taken, etc.) there is no data point for December 29 on the check time, the market will be checked 6 hours later, at 6 PM ET on December 30, 2022. If there is still no data point, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to December 29. \n\nIf Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to December 29. \n\nPlease note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc).
