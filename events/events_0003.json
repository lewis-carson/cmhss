As he refuses to get the vaccine, the Wimbledon champion is hopeful that US authorities will change any laws requiring COVID-19 vaccination for entry into the US in time for him to compete at the US Open.\n\nThis is a market on whether Novak Djokovic will play at least one point in the 2022 US Open for the Men's Singles Tournament. If Novak Djokovic plays at least one point in the 2022 US Open and the score is 15-0, or loses one point and the score is 0-15, then this will suffice to resolve the market to \"Yes.\".

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche). \n\nThis market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cFri 19 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. \nNote, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.)\nThe resolution data will be checked at 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 19 2021, and - if unavailable then - for every 3 hours until it is.\nIf CoinGecko is unavailable for the full day, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the price of Avalanche (AVAX). Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

        "description": "This is a scalar market on the price of cryptocurrency Avalanche (AVAX) on November 19, 2021, at 12:00 PM ET. \n\nThe lower bound for this market is $50, and the upper bound is $140. The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche). \n\nThis market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cFri 19 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. \nNote, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.)\nThe resolution data will be checked at 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 19 2021, and - if unavailable then - for every 3 hours until it is.\nIf CoinGecko is unavailable for the full day, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the price of Avalanche (AVAX). Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

The resolution source for this market will be https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases. \n\nThe 7-day moving average for the day of November 8 will be checked at 8:00 PM ET on November 12, 2021. If data for the day of November 8 is not accessible, the resolution source will be checked every 24 hours until it is available.

        "description": "This is a market on whether Eric Adams will win the Democratic primary for New York City Mayor in 2021. This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Adams is the winner of the Democratic primary for Mayor of New York City, and \"No\" otherwise. The primary is currently scheduled for June 22, 2021. In the event that the primary is not held on that date, the resolution of this market will be delayed until the primary takes place. If no primary is held in 2021, this market will resolve to \"No\". The resolution source for this market will be any official CNN publication that declares Eric Adams the primary winner. In the event of conflicting sources between CNN and WSJ (https://www.wsj.com) or Associated Press (https://apnews.com/), the market will only be resolved once there is a definitive winner. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d  if the hammer price at auction exceeds $2 million, and \u201cNo\u201d otherwise. Note this is a market on the final hammer price at the live auction, which does not include buyer\u2019s premium, fees, or taxes, and is not equivalent to \u201cprice realised\u201d as listed on Christie\u2019s website. As per Christie\u2019s, on the day of the auction, May 14, 2021, a video link to the live auction will be available on the website to the auction, where the auction can be followed live (https://webclient-chr1.auctionsolutions.com/ams-wc-ui/chrLiveM.jsp). This market will resolve according to the final hammer price, as indicated or broadcast from an official Christie\u2019s source. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

        "description": "This is a market on the final hammer price for Emily Ratajkowski\u2019s NFT \u201cBuying Myself Back: A Model for Redistribution\u201d, which is scheduled to be auctioned at Christie\u2019s on May 14, 2021 (https://www.christies.com/lot/lot--6317722/). This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d  if the hammer price at auction exceeds $2 million, and \u201cNo\u201d otherwise. Note this is a market on the final hammer price at the live auction, which does not include buyer\u2019s premium, fees, or taxes, and is not equivalent to \u201cprice realised\u201d as listed on Christie\u2019s website. As per Christie\u2019s, on the day of the auction, May 14, 2021, a video link to the live auction will be available on the website to the auction, where the auction can be followed live (https://webclient-chr1.auctionsolutions.com/ams-wc-ui/chrLiveM.jsp). This market will resolve according to the final hammer price, as indicated or broadcast from an official Christie\u2019s source. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",
