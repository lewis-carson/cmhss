    "description": "This is a market on whether a player who is not a Korean national wins the DreamHack Fall Starcraft 2 Masters tournament, to be held from September 7 to September 12.  If a player of Korean nationality wins the tournament, this market will resolve \u201cNo.\u201d  Otherwise, this market will resolve \u201cYes.\u201d  For the purposes of this market, only nationality is relevant, not where a player may currently reside.  The Korean players in this tournament are PartinG, Bunny, Dark, Trap, sOs, and Zoun.  All others are considered non-Korean. If the tournament is postponed to an end date on or before October 12, 2021, the same market conditions will apply. If the tournament is cancelled or postponed to an end date after October 12, 2021, the market will resolve 50/50.",

        "description": "This is a market on a month-to-month inflation, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPI-U), from October to November 2021.\n\nThe inflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the index increased by 0.8 percent or more (i.e. eighty-hundredths of 1%) from October 2021 to November 2021 and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS November 2021 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled for release on December 10, 2021, 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data. \n\n-------------------------\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote that the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.6%, 0.5%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.7%, the market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d, if it is 0.8%, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d).",

    "description": "This is a market on whether NASA will conduct a sustained flight of the Ingenuity Helicopter on Mars by April 12, 2021, 11:59 PM ET. A sustained flight will mean that the Ingenuity Helicopter successfully takes off, sustains flight for longer than 10 seconds and then lands upright. A successful launch and sustained flight will be confirmed by examining information presented during NASA\u2019s official video feed of the launch (https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/#Watch-Online) as well as information presented at the post-flight news briefing (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCryGec9PdUCLjpJW2mgCuLw) and data corroborated by NASA which reflects the status and timing of the flight. If NASA successfully conducts a sustained flight of the Ingenuity Helicopter by April 12, 2021 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. This market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d if NASA does not successfully conduct a sustained flight of the Ingenuity Helicopter by April 12, 2021 11:59 PM ET or if there is not enough information within one week (by April 19, 11:59 PM ET) to confirm sustained flight. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, this market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n",

If $SOL has a greater market cap than $ADA on the resolution date, this market will resolve to \u201cSolana\u201d. If the estimated market cap for the resolution date is exactly the same for both cryptocurrencies, this market will resolve 50/50.\n\nIf for any reason the resolution data is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be checked such as CoinMarketCap. In the event of an ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, historical market caps of each coin will be used (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano, https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana), precisely the first recorded measurement after 8:00 PM.\n--------------\nMarket Cap = Current Price x Circulating Supply\n\nRefers to the total market value of a cryptocurrency\u2019s circulating supply.",

If the resolution criteria are satisfied prior to that date, this market will resolve immediately. \u201cLive\u201d in this context can be defined as being deployed and usable on Optimism and publicly announced via the official Uniswap Twitter and/or blog. V3 can be defined as Uniswap v3.0.0 or greater. This market will resolve when Uniswap v3 is deployed on the mainnet of Optimism, with or without some bridging mechanism from Ethereum mainnet. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, this market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

Congress has defined those statutory emergency powers, available to the President upon the declaration of an emergency (so called \"National Emergency\"). Congress also can terminate an emergency declaration with a joint resolution enacted into law.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if, within this market's timeframe, President Joe Biden declares a new National Emergency. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\". \n\nThis market's timeframe spans from July 21 to August 31 (inclusive).\n\nPlease note for this market to resolve to \"Yes\" the national emergency declaration must be official, issued under authority of the National Emergencies Act by the Executive Office of the President, with a publication date within this market's timeframe. Any public announcement by President Biden without an official declaration will not suffice to resolve this market to \"Yes\". \n\nA continuation of any existing National Emergencies will not suffice to resolve this market to \"Yes\". An executive emergency order which is not subject to the provisions of the National Emergencies Act will not suffice to resolve this market to \"Yes\".  \n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the Federal Register of official documents published by the Executive Office of the President (https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/executive-office-of-the-president), however other official government sources may be used.",
