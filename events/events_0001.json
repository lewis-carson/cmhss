    "description": "This is a market on whether month-to-month inflation, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPI-U) will be 0.4% or more from July to August, when the BLS releases month-to-month inflation information for the preceding month of August on September 14, 2021, 8:30 AM ET. This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased by exactly 0.4 percent (i.e. forty hundredths of 1%) or more from July 2021 to August 2021. This market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d if the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased by less than 0.4 percent (i.e. forty hundredths of 1%) from July 2021 to August 2021. \n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS July 2021 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled for release on September 14, 2021, 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data. Note that the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.6%, 0.5%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.3%, the market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d, if it is 0.4%, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d). In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

    "description": "This is a market on whether New York City will meet Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s target to \u201cfully reopen\u201d by July 1, 2021. This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if at any time before July 1, 2021, 12:00 AM ET, an official announcement is made by the City of New York which has the effect of allowing all of the following to reopen at full capacity: restaurants, stores, shops, offices, hair salons, barber shops, gyms, arenas, stadiums, theaters, and museums. All of the previously listed establishments and venues must be allowed to reopen at full capacity for this market to resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. Reopening at full capacity will mean the establishments and venues listed above have no COVID-related capacity limits (i.e. they are able to return to their pre-COVID capacity limits), and no requirements for patrons or employees to physically distance from each other. This market will still resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the establishments and venues listed above reopen at full capacity, but such a reopening is restricted to only a subset of people who meet certain requirements--for example, they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative covid test within the last 72 hours. This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the previously listed venues reopen at full capacity, but there are still requirements to wear masks indoors. Otherwise, if the criteria for this market to resolve to \u201cYes\u201d are not met by the resolution date, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.  For the purpose of this market, an official announcement will include updates to official New York City webpages (e.g. https://www1.nyc.gov/site/coronavirus/index.page), and/or press releases or other statements to the press or public from the Office of the Mayor of New York City (https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news.page). In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n\nUpdate:\n- The reopening announcement must come from NYC or the Mayor\u2019s Office. A reopening announcement by only the State of New York or the Governor\u2019s Office will not count.\n- This market concerns whether, before July 1, 2021, NYC will announce that a full reopening (as defined in the rules) is allowed on or before July 1, 2021, not whether the City or its businesses will implement such a reopening on or before July 1, 2021.\n- If the reopening requires physically distancing, for either vaccinated or unvaccinated people, this market will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d\n",

        "description": "This is a market on whether New York City will meet Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s target to \u201cfully reopen\u201d by July 1, 2021. This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if at any time before July 1, 2021, 12:00 AM ET, an official announcement is made by the City of New York which has the effect of allowing all of the following to reopen at full capacity: restaurants, stores, shops, offices, hair salons, barber shops, gyms, arenas, stadiums, theaters, and museums. All of the previously listed establishments and venues must be allowed to reopen at full capacity for this market to resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. Reopening at full capacity will mean the establishments and venues listed above have no COVID-related capacity limits (i.e. they are able to return to their pre-COVID capacity limits), and no requirements for patrons or employees to physically distance from each other. This market will still resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the establishments and venues listed above reopen at full capacity, but such a reopening is restricted to only a subset of people who meet certain requirements--for example, they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative covid test within the last 72 hours. This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the previously listed venues reopen at full capacity, but there are still requirements to wear masks indoors. Otherwise, if the criteria for this market to resolve to \u201cYes\u201d are not met by the resolution date, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.  For the purpose of this market, an official announcement will include updates to official New York City webpages (e.g. https://www1.nyc.gov/site/coronavirus/index.page), and/or press releases or other statements to the press or public from the Office of the Mayor of New York City (https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news.page). In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n\nUpdate:\n- The reopening announcement must come from NYC or the Mayor\u2019s Office. A reopening announcement by only the State of New York or the Governor\u2019s Office will not count.\n- This market concerns whether, before July 1, 2021, NYC will announce that a full reopening (as defined in the rules) is allowed on or before July 1, 2021, not whether the City or its businesses will implement such a reopening on or before July 1, 2021.\n- If the reopening requires physically distancing, for either vaccinated or unvaccinated people, this market will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d\n",

    "description": "This is a scalar market on the number of new residential sales that the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will report for June 2021. The lower bound for this market is 600,000 and the upper bound is 900,000. This market will resolve on the Census\u2019 count of \"New Houses Sold\", in their \"Monthly New Residential Sales\" Report for the month of June 2021, scheduled to be released at the webpage https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html (see \"Current Press Release: Full Report [PDF]\" in the \"New Residential Sales\" section) , on July 26, 2021. The resolution source will be checked at 5:00 PM ET on July 26, 2021. If the source is unavailable at that time, or does not have the New Residential Sales data for June 2021, it will be checked the following day at 5:00 PM ET, and once daily at that time until the data is available. If at 5:00 PM ET on August 2, 2021 the data is still unavailable, this market will resolve to 750,000, which is between the upper and lower bounds of the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with residential sales. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

        "description": "This is a scalar market on the number of new residential sales that the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will report for June 2021. The lower bound for this market is 600,000 and the upper bound is 900,000. This market will resolve on the Census\u2019 count of \"New Houses Sold\", in their \"Monthly New Residential Sales\" Report for the month of June 2021, scheduled to be released at the webpage https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html (see \"Current Press Release: Full Report [PDF]\" in the \"New Residential Sales\" section) , on July 26, 2021. The resolution source will be checked at 5:00 PM ET on July 26, 2021. If the source is unavailable at that time, or does not have the New Residential Sales data for June 2021, it will be checked the following day at 5:00 PM ET, and once daily at that time until the data is available. If at 5:00 PM ET on August 2, 2021 the data is still unavailable, this market will resolve to 750,000, which is between the upper and lower bounds of the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with residential sales. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

    "description": "This is a market on whether President Biden will mention coronavirus 3 or more times during his address to a joint session of Congress, scheduled to take place on April 28, 2021. This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if President Biden cumulatively mentions any of the following words three or more times: \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, \u201ccovid\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d. For example, this market would resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if Biden mentions \u201ccoronavirus\u201d 5 times and none of the other variants (5 cumulative mentions) or if he mentions \u201ccoronavirus\u201d twice and \u201ccovid\u201d twice (4 cumulative mentions). This market will resolve to \"No\" otherwise. The resolution source for this market will be the official transcript of the joint address, as published by an official White House source (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/). Note that a mention of any of the listed words will be confirmed by searching the text of this document and counting the number of times that word appeared (all variations on capitalization will be counted). This market will resolve after an official transcript of the address is published and the number of mentions can be verified.\n\nUpdate: In response to trader inquiries, the market will resolve on April 29, 2021 at 9pm ET according to the transcript published at the resolution source that most accurately reflects the speech as presented by President Biden.",

    "description": "This is a market on whether SpaceX will successfully complete a launch of the next Starship intended to reach outer space, currently dubbed \"SN20\", by December 31st, 2021. A successful launch will mean that Starship takes off from its launchpad in Boca Chica, TX, and successfully reaches an altitude of 62 miles above sea level. The outcome will be corroborated by examining SpaceX\u2019s official video feed of the launch (https://www.youtube.com/c/SpaceX), as well as secondary video feeds or written reports if necessary.

Any subsequent anomaly (e.g. an explosion) after the vehicle reaches 62 miles will have no bearing on the outcome. Any name change of the Starship or replacement of \"SN20\" with another vehicle (i.e. \"SN21\", etc.) will have no bearing on the outcome of the market. Any SpaceX Starship launch that is not intended for outer space will have no bearing on the market. This market will resolve solely on whether the first Starship launch intended to reach outer space will successfully reach 62 miles above sea level.
