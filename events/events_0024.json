    "description": "This is a scalar market on what the margin of victory will be in the 2021 Peruvian Presidential Election between Keiko Fujimori and Pedro Castillo. The election is scheduled to take place on June 6, 2021. The lower bound for this market is -2 (Fujimori) and the upper bound is +4 (Castillo). Margin of victory will be calculated by the following formula: Castillo (percentage of vote) - Fujimori (percentage of vote). For instance, if Castillo received 49.3% of the vote, and Fujimori received 50.7% of the vote, the margin of victory would be (49.3% - 50.7%= -1.4%). Note that full unrounded percentages calculated from raw vote numbers will be used, and the total votes will be considered as Fujimori votes + Castillo votes. For instance, Fujimori\u2019s percentage would be calculated as 100 * (# Fujimori Votes / (# Fujimori Votes + # Castillo Votes)).\n\nThe resolution source will be https://www.onpe.gob.pe/. To allow for potential updates to results, the earliest resolution of this market will be 1.5 weeks after the election date, i.e. on June 17, 12 PM ET, upon which the resolution source will be checked. If the results are available at that time, the market will resolve according to the results posted on the website at that time. Note that these results need not be the final results \u2014 the market will resolve based on the numbers available at June 17, 12 PM ET exactly. If results are unavailable at the resolution source, the source will be checked a day later on June 18, 12 PM ET, and so on until results are available. If results are not available on the resolution source by June 30, 12 PM ET, the market will resolve to +0 margin of victory. Only the results on the webpage when checked at the resolution time will be considered. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, this market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the margin of victory. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.

    "description": "This is a market on the number of tweets which will be posted to Mark Cuban's Twitter account prior to the resolution date, February 17, 2021 at 3:00pm EST.\n\nAt 3:00pm EST on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @MCuban, shall exceed 3,478 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @MCuban, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@MCuban\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @MCuban just before 3:00 pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00 pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Mark Cuban, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the settlement source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, the lowest bracket will resolve to \"Yes\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, all contracts in this market will resolve as No. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @MarkCuban will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

    "description": "This is a market on the number of tweets that will be posted to White House Chief of Staff\u2019s Twitter account prior to the resolution date, March 12, 2021 at 3:00pm EST. \n\nAt 3:00pm EST on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @WHCOS, shall exceed 1506 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @WHCOS, then clicking the verified account labeled \u201c@WHCOS\u201d from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @WHCOS just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Ronald Klain, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @WHCOS will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

    "description": "In recent years revelations of infidelity between Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith came to light in a string of television interviews.

These episodes lead many to speculate there could be irreconcilable differences between the Smiths.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Jada Pinkett Smith and/or Willard Carroll Smith II announce that they are getting a divorce by September 1, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purpose of this market, an announcement by either Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith, or both, will be sufficient for a \"Yes\" resolution, regardless of whether the divorce later actually occurs, or whether the actual divorce occurs outside of the timeframe of this market.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official announcements by Jada Pinkett Smith and/or Will Smith (these may be made via social media, e.g. https://twitter.com/jadapsmith, https://www.instagram.com/willsmith/, etc), or statements made on their behalf by their official and/or legal representatives. However, credible reporting from other sources of either of them saying they will get divorced may be used (i.e. Will Smith shouts in a restaurant that he is divorcing Jada Pinkett Smith and footage of the encounter is leaked).",

This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @mtgreenee, then clicking the verified account labeled \u201c@mtgreenee\u201d from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @mtgreenee just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Marjorie Taylor Greene, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @mtgreenee will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

On the resolution date, it must be possible for an individual in the United States to create an account and post. Creating an account and posting requires that user-generated content is not restricted to responses (ie comments) to another user\u2019s content.

If there is a fee or subscription required to join, this market will still resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019s involvement must be public and verified via an official channel, and the platform must be substantially backed by or affiliated with Donald Trump--e.g. the platform uses his name explicitly, is heavily marketed as being affiliated with him, or he is an executive for the platform. Partnership with an existing platform such as Twitter or Parler will not be sufficient for this market to resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. If such a platform is temporarily inaccessible due to maintenance, system overload, or DDOS attack, resolution of this market will be delayed up to 72 hours. If the platform is inaccessible on the resolution date due to a lack of a web-hosting service provider, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.

        "description": "A safety car in Formula 1 is a car which limits the speed of the cars on the track when the track is under caution conditions. If an accident or inclement weather (typically heavy rain) prevents normal racing from continuing safely, the Race Director calls for a \"safety car\" period, which sees marshals wave yellow flags and hold \"SC\" boards, pending the car in question entering the track. \n\nThis is a market on the number of safety car (SC) periods run at the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, which is scheduled to take place over 51 laps of the 6.003-kilometre Baku City Circuit on Sunday, June 12.\n\nThe market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if there are 2 or more safety car periods in the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nNote: \n- For the purposes of this market, only Safety Car periods (SC) are to be counted. A virtual safety car period will not count toward market resolution. If a virtual safety car period is upgraded to become a full safety car period, it may then be counted as 1 safety car period.\n- A red flag period will not count as a safety car period, but a safety car period running for 1 lap or more that becomes a red flag will count as 1 safety car period. \n- If the race begins under a safety car, usually done in case of rain causing a standing start to be deemed unsafe, this will count as a safety car, as long as 1 counted lap has taken place.\n- If for any reason the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix is rescheduled to a different time or date on or before June 19, 2022, the same market conditions will apply. If the race does not finish by June 19, and \"Yes\" conditions are not met, this market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the official F1 website: https://www.formula1.com/, particularly the race report and lap-by-lap links that will populate the website under https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2022/Azerbaijan.html",

If, for example, the drivers earn 25 and 18 points, respectively, their constructor team will be awarded 43 points, which are the points won by both drivers combined.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cRed Bull\u201d if Red Bull Racing RBPT collects more points than Ferrari and to \u201cFerrari\u201d if Ferrari collects more points than Red Bull Racing RBPT at the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. If both teams collect the same number of points, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nIf for any reason the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix is rescheduled to a different time and date on or before June 19, 2022, the same market conditions will apply.
