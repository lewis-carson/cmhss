    "description": "This is a market on whether a team from a \u201cminor\u201d region will get out of the play-in stage and reach the group stage of the League of Legends 2021 World Championship. The play-in stage runs from October 5, 2021, to October 9, 2021, and you can find more information on its process at this address: https://liquipedia.net/leagueoflegends/World_Championship/2021/Play-In\nFor the purpose of this bet, a \u201cminor\u201d region is one of the following six : the LJL (Japan) ; the TCL (Turkey) ; the LLA (Latin America) ; the LCO (Australia) ; the CBLOL (Brazil) and the LCL (Russia).\nIf at least one team from these regions qualifies for the group stage, the market will resolve \u201cYes\u201d.

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-luna). \n\nThis market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cFri 19 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. \nNote, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.)\nThe resolution data will be checked at 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 19 2021, and - if unavailable then - for every 3 hours until it is.\nIf CoinGecko is unavailable for the full day, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the price of Terra ($LUNA). Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-luna). \n\nThis market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cFri 19 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. \nNote, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.)\nThe resolution data will be checked at 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 19 2021, and - if unavailable then - for every 3 hours until it is.\nIf CoinGecko is unavailable for the full day, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the price of Terra ($LUNA). Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

    "description": "This is a scalar market on what the price of $ADA will be on October 1, 2021, at 12:00 PM ET. The lower bound for this market is $1.00, and the upper bound is $3.30. The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano). This market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cFri 1 October 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on October 1, 2021. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If Coingecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $ADA\u2019s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano). This market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cFri 1 October 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on October 1, 2021. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If Coingecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $ADA\u2019s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",
