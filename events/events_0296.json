        "description": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump signs any federal legislation or performs any executive action enacting a tariff on imports of semiconductors into the United States by September 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOnly tariffs specifically targeting semiconductors will qualify. For example, a general tariff (tariffs on all imports into the U.S.) or country-specific tariff (tariffs on all imports from China) will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nTariffs on semiconductors from a specific country will qualify.\n\nAny tariff which is officially enacted within the market's time frame will qualify, regardless of when the tariff goes into effect.\n\nThis market's primary resolution source will be official information from the Trump administration; however, a consensus of credible information will also be used.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nIf such an agreement is officially reached before the resolution date, this market will resolve to \"Yes\", regardless of if/when the agreement goes into effect.\n\nAgreements to extend tariff exemptions will qualify if announced as an individualized extension. However, tariff exemptions which are announced as part of a class of exemptions and do not reflect individual deals - such as Trump\u2019s April 9 pause on all reciprocal tariffs other than those on China - will not qualify (see: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/modifying-reciprocal-tariff-rates-to-reflect-trading-partner-retaliation-and-alignment/).  \n\nInformal and unilateral announcements which do not constitute a finalized agreement will not count.\n \nAgreements that include the United States and the listed country/entity as parties, even if they also involve other countries, will qualify for resolution.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting confirming an agreement has been reached.",
