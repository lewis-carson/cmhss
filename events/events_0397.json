        "description": "Citizens Financial Group is estimated to release earnings on October 15, 2025. The Street consensus estimate for Citizens Financial Group\u2019s GAAP EPS for the relevant quarter is $1.03. This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Citizens Financial Group reports GAAP EPS greater than $1.03 for the relevant quarter in its next quarterly earnings release. Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No.\" The resolution source will be the GAAP EPS listed in the company\u2019s official earnings documents.\n\nIf Citizens Financial Group releases earnings without GAAP EPS, then the market will resolve according to the GAAP EPS figure reported by SeekingAlpha. If no such figure is published within 96h of market close (4:00:00pm ET) on the day earnings are announced, the market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nIf the company does not release earnings within 45 calendar days of the estimated earnings date, this market will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nNote: Subsequent restatements, corrections, or revisions made to the initially announced GAAP EPS figure will not qualify for resolution.\nNote: The strike prices used in these markets are derived from SeekingAlpha estimates, and reflect the consensus of sell-side analyst estimates for GAAP EPS.\nNote: All figures will be rounded to the nearest cent using standard rounding.\nNote: For the purposes of this market, IFRS EPS will be treated as GAAP EPS.\nNote: For the purposes of this market, GAAP EPS refers to diluted GAAP EPS, unless this is not published, in which case it refers to basic GAAP EPS.",

    "description": "Abbott Laboratories is estimated to release earnings on October 15, 2025. The Street consensus estimate for Abbott Laboratories\u2019s non-GAAP EPS for the relevant quarter is $1.30. This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Abbott Laboratories reports non-GAAP EPS greater than $1.30 for the relevant quarter in its next quarterly earnings release. Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No.\" The resolution source will be the non-GAAP EPS listed in the company\u2019s official earnings documents.\n\nIf Abbott Laboratories releases earnings without non-GAAP EPS, then the market will resolve according to the non-GAAP EPS figure reported by SeekingAlpha. If no such figure is published within 96h of market close (4:00:00pm ET) on the day earnings are announced, the market will resolve according to the GAAP EPS listed in the company\u2019s official earnings documents; or, if not published there, according to the GAAP EPS provided by SeekingAlpha. If no GAAP EPS number is available from either source at that time, the market will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d (For the purposes of this market, GAAP EPS refers to diluted GAAP EPS, unless it is not published, in which case it refers to basic GAAP EPS.)\n\nIf the company does not release earnings within 45 calendar days of the estimated earnings date, this market will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nNote: Subsequent restatements, corrections, or revisions made to the initially announced non-GAAP EPS figure will not qualify for resolution.\nNote: The strike prices used in these markets are derived from SeekingAlpha estimates, and reflect the consensus of sell-side analyst estimates for non-GAAP EPS.\nNote: All figures will be rounded to the nearest cent using standard rounding.\nNote: For the purposes of this market, IFRS EPS will be treated as GAAP EPS.\nNote: If multiple versions of non-GAAP EPS are published, the market will resolve according to the primary headline non-GAAP EPS number, which is typically presented on a diluted basis. If diluted is not published, then basic non-GAAP EPS will qualify.",

        "description": "Abbott Laboratories is estimated to release earnings on October 15, 2025. The Street consensus estimate for Abbott Laboratories\u2019s non-GAAP EPS for the relevant quarter is $1.30. This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Abbott Laboratories reports non-GAAP EPS greater than $1.30 for the relevant quarter in its next quarterly earnings release. Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No.\" The resolution source will be the non-GAAP EPS listed in the company\u2019s official earnings documents.\n\nIf Abbott Laboratories releases earnings without non-GAAP EPS, then the market will resolve according to the non-GAAP EPS figure reported by SeekingAlpha. If no such figure is published within 96h of market close (4:00:00pm ET) on the day earnings are announced, the market will resolve according to the GAAP EPS listed in the company\u2019s official earnings documents; or, if not published there, according to the GAAP EPS provided by SeekingAlpha. If no GAAP EPS number is available from either source at that time, the market will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d (For the purposes of this market, GAAP EPS refers to diluted GAAP EPS, unless it is not published, in which case it refers to basic GAAP EPS.)\n\nIf the company does not release earnings within 45 calendar days of the estimated earnings date, this market will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nNote: Subsequent restatements, corrections, or revisions made to the initially announced non-GAAP EPS figure will not qualify for resolution.\nNote: The strike prices used in these markets are derived from SeekingAlpha estimates, and reflect the consensus of sell-side analyst estimates for non-GAAP EPS.\nNote: All figures will be rounded to the nearest cent using standard rounding.\nNote: For the purposes of this market, IFRS EPS will be treated as GAAP EPS.\nNote: If multiple versions of non-GAAP EPS are published, the market will resolve according to the primary headline non-GAAP EPS number, which is typically presented on a diluted basis. If diluted is not published, then basic non-GAAP EPS will qualify.",

Changes in the methodology by which Silver Bulletin calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. If Silver Bulletin's approval rating becomes permanently unavailable, RealClearPolitics will be used.\n\nThe resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.",

Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPluralization/possessive of the listed term will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context.\n\nIf this market requires a specified number of mentions of a person\u2019s first or last name, a full-name mention will count as one mention (e.g., if a market is about \u201cJoe / Biden 5+ times,\u201d a mention of \u201cJoe Biden\u201d will count once).\n\nThis market is explicitly about scheduled events featuring both Donald Trump and the Prime Minister of Israel (https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/topic/calendar/). All such scheduled events featuring both on this date count. Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of named, scheduled events, or which feature one named individual but not the other, will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the events contain a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by September 29, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".",
