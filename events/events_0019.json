    "title": "Will Labor win more seats than the Liberal-Nationals in the 2022 Australian Federal Election?",
    "description": "The election for the 47th Parliament of Australia is scheduled to take place on May 21, 2022. In the 2019 Australian Federal Election a coalition between the Liberal Party of Australia (LPA), the National Party of Australia (NPA), the Liberal National Party of Queensland (some of whom sit with the LPA, some with the NPA), and the Country Liberal Party of the Northern Territory\u00a0(who held no seats in the House in the 46th Parliament) captured a majority in the House of Representatives by winning 77 seats. The oppositional Australian Labor Party (ALP) trailed with 68 seats.\n\nFollowing the election, the Liberal-National coalition lost two seats as two members of coalition parties chose to become Independents and sit on the crossbench. This left the governing coalition with only 75 seats by the end of the 46th Parliament. \n\nIf the Australian Labor Party (ALP) wins more House seats than the Liberal-National coalition wins in the election for the 47th Parliament of Australia, this market will resolve to \"Yes\". Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf the ALP and the Liberal-National coalition win the exact same number of seats, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf the election for the 47th Parliament of Australia does not occur before January 1, 2023, 12:00:00 AM ET, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nIf it can be determined before January 1, 2023, 12:00:00 AM ET the Australian Labor Party (ALP) wins more House seats than the Liberal-National coalition wins in the election for the 47th Parliament of Australia, this market may resolve to \"Yes\" at the time such a determination is made. If it can be determined before January 1, 2023, 12:00:00 AM ET the Liberal-National coalition wins the same number as or more House seats than the ALP in the election for the 47th Parliament of Australia, this market may resolve to \"No\" at the time such a determination is made.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official information from the government of Australia (e.g. https://results.aec.gov.au/). However, a definitive consensus of credible media sources will also suffice.\n",

Please note however that varying capitalizations within the aforementioned words suffice to resolve the market to \u201cYes\u201d, as they are the same letters in the same\u00a0order.\n\nThis is a market on whether Elon Musk\u2019s verified Twitter account (https://twitter.com/elonmusk) will publish a tweet specifically containing the words \u201cdoge\u201d, \u201c$DOGE\u201d, or \u201cdogecoin\u201d on any date between February 17, 2022 and March 18, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET (inclusive). If Elon Musk\u2019s verified Twitter account publishes a tweet containing the words \u201cdoge\u201d, \u201c$DOGE\u201d, or \u201cdogecoin\u201d on any date between February 17, 2022 and March 18, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET (inclusive), this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. Otherwise this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be Elon Musk\u2019s verified Twitter account: https://twitter.com/elonmusk. \n\nIf the URL of Elon Musk\u2019s verified Twitter account changes before the resolution of this question, whichever URL the Twitter account moves to will be the valid resolution source for this market. Resolution of this market will be unaffected by the aforementioned tweet later being deleted.

        "description": "In a football season, clubs typically compete in a number of domestic competitions, such as a league and one or more cup competitions, as well as sometimes in continental competitions. A quadruple in association football is achieved when a club team wins four or more trophies in a single season.\n\nThis season (2021-22) English club Liverpool FC has a chance to achieve quadruple - defined for the purpose of this market as winning the following four competitions: English League Cup, FA Cup, Premier League and UEFA Champions\u00a0League.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Liverpool FC wins all four of these competitions and \"No\" otherwise.\nThis market will resolve to \"No\" as soon as Liverpool drops out of the FA Cup or the UEFA Champions League.\n\nIf for whatever reason by June 30, 2022 (11:59:59 PM ET), it is still unknown whether Liverpool FC has won any of the competitions listed above, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\n--------------------------------\nAt this market's inception time (April 18, 2022), Liverpool FC have already won this season's League Cup; are currently second in the Premier League, a point behind champions Man City with just seven games to play; advanced to UEFA Champions League semi-finals (to compete with Villareal CF) and to the FA Cup final (to face Chelsea London). The last possibly decisive game is scheduled for May 28 (UEFA CL final).",

This market will resolve according to the \u201cC\u201d (aka closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cThu 10 March 2022, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone.

    "description": "In Response to Trader Inquiry: As per market rules, this market only concerns Kanye West\u2019s Instagram Posts, both the text and image portions of them. Stories do not count. \n\nKanye West has recently referred to Kim Kardashian's present (as of February 19, 2022) boyfriend, Pete Davidson, as \u201cSkete\u201d on social media.\n\nThis is a market on whether Kanye West's verified Instagram account (https://www.instagram.com/kanyewest/) will use the specific term \"Skete\" in any post made between February 19, 2022 (12:00:00 PM ET), and February 28, 2022 (11:59:59 PM ET) (inclusive). This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Kanye West's verified Instagram account uses the term \"Skete\" in any upcoming post made between February 19, 2022 (12:00:00 PM ET), and February 28, 2022 (11:59:59 PM ET) (inclusive). Otherwise this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be Kanye West's verified Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/kanyewest/, however credible media sources will also suffice.\n\nOnly the clearly delineated word \u201cSkete\u201d will trigger a \u201cYes\u201d resolution. Variations of \u201cSkete\u201d which contain other and extraneous symbols and which are not in the exact order of the trigger word herein listed will not result in a \u201cYes\u201d resolution. Please note, an appearance of the trigger term \u201cSkete\u201d displaying capitalizations at variance with the word herein delineated WILL RESULT in a \u201cYes\u201d resolution so long as the letters of the term are in the correct order. Further, an appearance of the term \u201cSkete\u201d with up to 2 spaces between each letter will result in a \u201cYes\u201d resolution, however any more spaces between any two letters in the trigger term will result in the market resolving to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nIf the URL of Kanye West\u2019s verified Instagram account changes before the resolution of this question, whichever URL the Instagram account moves to will be the valid resolution source for this market. For the purpose of this market\u2019s resolution, an image posted by Kanye West's verified Instagram account containing the trigger term \"Skete\" will result in a \u201cYes\u201d resolution. For the purpose of this market\u2019s resolution, regardless of the font used in the image portion of the Instagram post, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the term \u201cSkete\u201d can be clearly read. No comments posted by Kanye West\u2019s verified Instagram account will count toward the resolution of this question, only posts.\n\nResolution of this market will be unaffected by the aforementioned Instagram post later being edited or deleted. This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if an Instagram post containing the trigger term is published regardless of the individual publishing the post on the account.",
