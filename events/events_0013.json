This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the referee of the match stops and ends the fight at any time before the completion of the final round. This market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d otherwise. This market will resolve on completion of the match, which is scheduled to take place on June 6, 2021 at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. If the number of total rounds in the match changes between the creation of this market and the actual fight, the meaning of \u201cfinal round\u201d will be interpreted accordingly (e.g. if the total rounds in the match is changed from 8 to 10, \u201cfinal round\u201d will mean the 10th round). If, for any reason, this match is postponed and a new fight date is set for June 30, 2021, or earlier, the same rules for market resolution will apply for the rescheduled fight. If this match is rescheduled for any date after June 30, 2021 or canceled altogether, the market will resolve to 50-50. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, this market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

Results of this market will be decided by official Steam player count (\"Peak Today\") available at https://store.steampowered.com/stats/.\u00a0\n\nIf Elden Ring is #1-5 or tied for any of those spots, the market will resolve \"Yes\", and otherwise \"No.\"\u00a0\n\nIn the event the resolution source is not available on March 15, 2022 at 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible source will be chosen. If no other credible sources are available, the source will be checked every 24 hours until March 22, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET, when the market will resolve 50-50.\n\n\nThe games listed at the resolution source will be ranked from highest to lowest based on the amounts in the \"Peak Today\" column. In the case of ties, the market will use standard competition ranking (\"1224\" ranking),\u00a0 where each game's ranking number is 1 plus the number of games ranked above it.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/stats/Steam-Game-and-Player-Statistics",

If Coingecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith by the MIC to resolve the market. Y\n\nou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $ADA\u2019s price.

Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET.

(To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If CoinGecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $MATIC\u2019s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

    "description": "This is a scalar market on what the price of $DOT will be on November 1, 2021, at 12:00 PM ET. The lower bound for this market is $20, and the upper bound is $60. The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polkadot). This market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cMon 1 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 1, 2021. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If CoinGecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $DOT\u2019s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

        "description": "This is a market on whether Hungary or Portugal will win their Euro 2020 match, scheduled for June 15, 2021 at 12:00 PM ET. This market will resolve to \u201cHungary\u201d if Hungary wins the match, or \u201cPortugal\u201d if Portugal wins the match. If the match ends in a tie, the market will resolve to 50-50. If, for any reason, this match is postponed and a new match date is set for a start time of June 22, 2021, 12:00 PM ET or earlier, the same rules for market resolution will apply for the rescheduled match.
