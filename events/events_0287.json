Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPluralization/possessive of the listed term will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nThis market is explicitly events with Bernie Sanders (https://act.berniesanders.com/signup/rsvp-oligarchy-chicago/?source=website-oligarchy). Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of the named, scheduled events will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the event contains a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by August 24, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source will be video of the events.",

A consensus of credible reporting may also be used.",
