The market will be settled based on the FIA\u2019s official qualifying results, regardless of any subsequent penalties, disqualifications, or changes to the starting grid.\n\nFor example, if a driver sets the fastest qualifying time but later receives a grid penalty or is moved down the starting order, the market will still resolve to \u201cYes\u201d for that driver.\n\nThe resolution source will be the official Formula 1 website and a consensus of credible sports news reporting.",

Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No\".\n\nA \u201crecovered\u201d item must be located and taken into possession by law enforcement authorities or the Louvre Museum to qualify. \n\nA single complete item (e.g., a tiara, brooch, or one earring from a pair) will suffice for a \u201cYes\u201d resolution for that piece or set, even if a element like a pearl or a stone is missing; however, recovery of only a fragment, detached gem, or partial component (e.g., a loose stone or frame fragment) will not suffice.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official statements from the Louvre Museum or the French government. If no such statement is available, the market will resolve based on a consensus of credible reporting.",
