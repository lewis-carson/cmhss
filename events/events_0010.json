Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThe resolution data for July 28 will be checked on July 29, 2022 (12 PM ET), and can only resolve after the check.\n\nIf for any reason (e.g. error, no data taken, etc.) there is no data point for July 28 on the check time, the market will be checked 6 hours later, at 6 PM ET on July 29, 2022. If there is still no data point, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to July 28.\n\nIf Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to July 28.\n\nPlease note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc).

It means not every stream on Spotify is eligible for Charts. Some songs may have fewer chart-eligible streams than others, depending on streaming behavior.",
