The market will be settled based on the FIA\u2019s official qualifying results, regardless of any subsequent penalties, disqualifications, or changes to the starting grid. For example, if a driver sets the fastest qualifying time but later receives a grid penalty or is moved down the starting order, the market will still resolve to \"Yes\" for that driver.\n\nThe resolution source will be the official Formula 1 website and credible sports news reporting.",
